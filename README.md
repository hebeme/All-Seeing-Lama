# All-Seeing-Lama

Not much of this software is mine, the goal was just to make it esier to use so it can be deployed more simply.

The goal is to create a large database of information and merge it to the main repo weekly.

Feel free to commit changes to the app/DUMP-FILES/ directory.

If you want this script to become exponentially more usefull, than pick up a SDR and get recording and commiting.

Sorry about the name, I just watched The Emporers New Groove.
